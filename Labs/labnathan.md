## Met All Requirements

[ + ] Using a total of six JavaScript 'prompt' or 'confirm' statements along the lines of our class demo on Monday, have a user answer six questions.

Passed

[ + ] The user's response to each question should be stored in a separate variable. Name your variables carefully.

Passed

[ + ] Using these responses, return an alert to the user that concatenates their response into some kind of reply like we did in class.

Passed - Very cool how you created a function to show all the responses on the DOM. Really cleaned up your code and made it look nice and straightforward.

[ + ] In addition, for each response, create a console.log() message that indicates the user's response, as we showed in class.

Passed

[ + ] In the HTML file, place the six questions within a series of <p> tags so that they are listed on the screen.

Passed

[ + ] If there are any lingering issues with the setup or functionality of your laptop and the software installations, we need to individually address that right away in lab.

## Idiomatic Style

Passed - Get into the habit of leaving comments in your code. This assignment was fairly straightforward but leaving comments as to why you created a function or what a for loop is doing will get you in a good routine. You don't want to go crazy with comments, just know they will help you when you start making more abstract applications where you might not remember why you wrote a piece of code the way you did. For example a good comment in this would assignment would be on line 9:
// Make sure the answers in the QandA array match up with the elements in the ids array otherwise your answers will be off on your for loop


## Submission/Git Flow

Create Secret Gist: Passed

Great job! Really liked how you used a function and a for loop to display all your answers back to the user.
